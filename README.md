# GIT ANALYTIC
Git Analytic is a single-page web application to visualize data from any public Github repository. I had two main objectives going into this project: 1. to create a data visualization using D3, a Javascript front-end library that uses Scaleable Vector Graphics to create dynamic and ineractive visualizations; 2. to pull data from a 3rd-party API, in this case, Github.
